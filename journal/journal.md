The alcohol sensor project is using the same type of alcohol sesnor that is required for my design. This project helps me to understand how the to connect the MQ-3 to the micro:Bit. This project was used to help me understand the basics of the MQ-3 sensor and helped me get a better grasp on how to code with it.

This project is similar to mine as it uses an MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor and connects it to sereis of LED lights. This has a similar design as to what I want to complete just with a alternative purpose. From this project was the basis of my idea of using LED lights, and helped me understand how to code them to react with the MQ-3 Acohol sensor.

### Arduino Alcohol Detector | MQ-3 Sensor ###

The Arduino Alcohol Detector | MQ-3 Sensor project uses a MQ-3 Sensor and when over the set limiot the buzzer will go off. This is related to my project as it has the basis of when a certain B.A.C limit is reached it casues a reaction from an external device. This design allows me to veiw the etireity of the process that was required to make this and allows me to veiw the code.

### RING PONG ###

![Image](P5.jpg)

The Gyroscope project is related to this project as it uses readings from an external component then uses this reading and causes it to have a reaction with the Ring Light. This allows me to understand how to correctly connect and external device correctly.

### NeoPixel Animation with Gestures ###

https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/danionescu/neopixel-animation-with-gestures-6322bf?ref=search&ref_id=RGB%20Ring&offset=19

The Geopixel Animation design project has similar factors to the current project underway. The project uses the same RGB Ring Light, and has a similar function of using reading from an external device to cause an action with the Ring Light. This allows me to understand the more complexe coding of the Ring light.

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->
To create a mature social game that allows players to interact using a sensor.

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->
### Final Design Concept ###

A drinking game where each player breathes on an alcohol sensor, the sesnor then relays the level to a ring light that lights a certain colour (determined by the B.A.C) this colour determines what the strength of the next drink is.

This is a group game. At each turn the player uses the the Alcohol Sensor, once the level of B.A.C in their breath has been determined the player will drink the required drink and then complete a random activity (this can be determined by the colour or a alternative way). Once their turn is up the next player goes.

The type of alchol each colour represents is determined by the players, but the game is designed that as the B.A.C increases the Alcohol Content in the drink selected will decrease. 

This game will be using a MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor and 24 RGB LED Ring Module.

The game will be played off of a similar layout of a dartboard. This is so that the players can record what drinks each colour is for and for the activity points. This layout will also be a kind of box with a removable back, all the wires for this game will be run through the back of the board, this is due to the fact that this is a drinking game and if alcohol came in contact with the electronics the game would break. The removable back is so that the batteries are easily changed if they go flat.

The motivation for this concept was the idea of creating a fun and intersting way to choose a playeers next drink it also creates a new game that can be personalised for each player.

### Technical Development ###

The technical development for this project began with connecting the mico:Bit to the MQ-3 sensor. This was done using the analogue read pin and setting it to Pin 0. The wiring for component was straitfoward. An external battery was required to run the MQ-3 sensor due to that the Micro:Bit battery was operating the Ring Lights. 

![Image](MQ-3_1.jpg)
![Image](MQ-3_2.jpg)
![Image](MQ-3_3.jpg)

From there the MQ_3 Sensor was connected with the Ring Light. This was done by sending the reasing from the MQ-3 through the micro:Bit where the code would then turn the number into a colour that would then input input it to the Ring Light. These was completed using Pins 1 and 0. wiring for this process was similar to the first but instead of having an external battery the Ring was connected with the micro:Bit.

A main component of the technical development was that rings had to be created so that the wiring could be attached to the micro:Bit without a breadboard. This was done through the process of soldering. A ring was created out of 1mm alloy and wrapped around a small screw that matched the diameter of the hole in the micro:Bit. This ring end was then soldered together and later attached to the appropiate wire so that it could be connected to the micro:Bit.

### Fabrication ###

When starting this project I was unsure in what to contain the game in that would make it functional as well as portable. It was decided that box would be used to contain the game as it would stop liquids from getting into the circuits. A prototype was made for the project to determine whether it would be a good match to the project.

![Image](Prot_1.jpg)
![Image](Prot_2.jpg)

The prototype was made to 1:4 scale. 

I took inspiration for the basic design of the box from a timber dartboard. 
![Image](.jpg)

7cm Plywood timber was used in the making of the box. This was chosen due to the sturdyness of the ply as well as the asthetics of the grain in the ply. 

![Image](1.jpg)

The ply was then stained with a hazelnut stain, this was all for asthestic purposes.

![Image](2.jpg)

Next in the process of assembling the box was the process of measuring a gluing all the pieces together. For this I measured all the pieces that were required on the ply and used a small handsaw to cut the timber. From there the edges were sanded down to the line previously measured. For this sandpaper P80, P60 and P120 were used. After this nail glue was used to stick the front and sides together. The back was left unglued as Brass Hinges were put in so that the back of the project was accessibe for battery changes.

Once the back was placed on with the hinges 2 holes were srewed into the front of the box this was to allow the wires from the MQ-3 Sensor and the RGB Ring light to be fed through to the back.

All that remained was feeding the wires through the slots and attaching them to the micro:Bit.

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


#### Challenges Thus far ####

Challenges that have presented themselves thus far is having to learn how to understand the MQ-3 tables so that the breathalyser can be callibrated. This process has yet to be completed and is currently in the define phase of learning and understanding the code used to create the callibration using Raspberry Pi. 

Another Challenge that has been completed was the wiring required to correclty connect the Breathyliser to the micro:Bit. This process reached completion. The method used to reach the outcome was the Double Diamond method also. The Discover phase was looking online at Git Hub and Audino at projects using the MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor, and seeing how they wired their projects together. The Define phase was understanding what each output and input on the MQ-3 was, this was completed by looking at designs of the product and how each version differentiates. The development phase was connecting all the wires and testing to see if this gave the correct reading, this was done by placing a bottle of vodka over the senor and seeing of the number that was presented on the micro:Bit LED's changed. 

The final challenge that has been presented thus far is the connecting of the 24 x RGB Ring Light to the Breathalyser. This task is in the development phase. The Disocover phase was looking at the problem and finding ways that a code can be changed so that instead of the number increasing on the LED screen on the micro:Bit the lights on the Ring change as well. The Define phase was used to cross reference other works on connecting an LED to a micro:Bit as an output.

### Fabrication ###

The fabrication for this project has just entered into the development phase where materials are being bought and assembled. To get to this phase the double diamond method was also used. I had wanted to make something portable and simplistic, as this was a drinking game i hadnt wanted the design to be too complex and also wanted it to have some style features. Originally it was going to be similar to a board game. It was made apparent that this was not appropiate for a game that involved liquids, it was also suggested that the nature of the game would make certain components difficult to remember as the game progressed this changed the external design of the board so that a white board could be incuded so these components could be easily seen and . 

#### Challenges Thus Far ####

A challenge that presented itself was due to the nature of the game involving liquid it was likly that the electronics on the project would get wet and as such the game would be destroyed this was corrected when I went to find ways to keep the electronics out oif the way of the alcohol. I looked at alternative materials and containers that would protect the electronics. In the end inspiraction was taken from a Dart board and the idea of having a woodern box, with all the wiring inside and a detachable back for access to the batteries.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->

With this project I found that all the videos and tutorials i found about operating and coding with the MQ-3 sensor highly usefull this was due to that I had never worked with this component before and allowed me to understand how it worked so i was able to create code that worked well with the product. The most successful
